First foray into Java. Just a random program used to chaeck out various features
of the language as I read about it.

								November 2020

Developed in Eclipse - also a learning curve.


# some notes on building java prog outside eclipse
# manual building of a runnable jar file

mkdir build		# if it doesn't exist already
mkdir build/classes
javac -sourcepath src -d build/classes src/myshapes/*.java
# notice project is "myshapes" and TestShapes is the class file containing main()
# the myshapes.TestShapes mirrors the dir structure myshapes/TestShapes.java
java -cp build/classes/ myshapes.TestShapes
mkdir build/jar
jar cfm build/jar/TestShapes.jar shapesManifest -C build/classes .
java -jar build/jar/TestShapes.jar 


# now for doing the same with ant
# see build.xml

ant  clean
ant  compile
ant  jar
ant  run

# or 
ant  clean compile jar run

# Then you can run the jar directly with

java -jar build/jar/TestShapes.jar
